## ⚡️ Overview

## 🔥 Experience

This project allowed me to develop a complete reflection on a Full-stack project and to improve my knowledge on Back-end technologies. <br/> This project is the most significant that I have been able to do, it requires a complete reflection upstream on the architecture to be exploited. I was able to improve my Back-end skills due to the use of new tools (Socket.io).
I was also able to significantly increase the quality of my code, especially on the Front-end part of the project. <br/>
I am still working on this project to improve it as much as possible before putting it online.
